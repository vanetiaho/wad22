# WAD2 Project description

This project is a web application built with Vue, Supabase, and other integrated APIs. It helps students and remote workers find the best cafés and study spots by allowing users to search and filter locations based on WiFi quality, noise levels, power outlet availability, and opening hours. It features an interactive map with real-time crowd updates, user reviews and ratings, and personalized profiles to save favorite spots. This makes it easier to find productive, comfortable environments quickly and reliably.
